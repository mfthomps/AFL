RESim integration with AFL

Pass timeout from afl to resim on hello message
** NO, does not give RESim enough time to catch the crash, i.e.,
time it takes os to kill the process.  

The resim fuzz/trim operation is first used to create a
trimmed input file that is not padded.  We then pad what afl
gives us to the minimum bytes needed by the service.
This requires configuration changes by service.

This is binary fuzzing without initial seeds.  
Human assisted/driven fuzzing.  Use resim to generate seed cases;
fuzz; take best new paths and human assist those.
Automate using trackio?
